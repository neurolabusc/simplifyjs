## Mesh Simplification

This repository provides different variations of Sven Forstmann's mesh simplification method. The [live demo web page](https://neurolabusc.github.io/simplifyjs/) allows users to interactively adjust parameters. Several ports are provided: the pure JavaScript NiiVue method is fast but does not support [UV Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_mapping). The pure JavaScript Koo and WebAssembly (WASM) methods support UV mapping, with the latter being faster.
